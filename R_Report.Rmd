## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document involving a small analysis on the **mpg** dataset. The dataset is a part of **ggplot** package present in R. Dataset comprises of car details including manufacturer, model, display, year, cylinder, transmission, drive, city, miles per gallon on highway, fl and class

### Task-1
The first analysis is to create a dataframe(table) from mpg which satisfies the following conditions:

  * Cars with manual transmission
  * Cars having 8 cylinders
  * Cars with 4 wheel drive
  * Table is present in descending miles per gallon


```{r cars}
# storing mpg datset from ggplot2 package to cars dataframe
cars <- ggplot2::mpg
# Creating subset which have rows with 8 cylinder, 4 wheel drive and manual transmission
new.car <- subset(cars, cars$cyl == 8 & cars$drv == 4 & grepl("manual", cars$trans))
# Order in descending miles per gallom
new.car <- new.car[order(-new.car$hwy),] 
# Display the dataset in table format
knitr::kable(new.car,  caption = "Car models with 8 cylinder, 4 wheel drive and manual transmission")
```

### Task-2

Plot to show the difference in mpg on highway each year for Audi, Nissan and Honda and show 95% CI on the mean

```{r pressure}

# Creating a subset of Cars considering only Audi, Honda and Nissan as manufacturers
new_table<-subset(cars,grepl("audi", cars$manufacturer) | grepl("nissan", cars$manufacturer) | grepl("honda", cars$manufacturer))

# Calculating 95% confidence Interval for the mean value 
m <- mean(new_table$hwy)
v <- var(new_table$hwy)
sd <- sqrt(v)
n <- length(new_table$hwy)
lower.range <- m - 1.96*(sd/sqrt(n))
higher.range <- m + 1.96*(sd/sqrt(n))

require(ggplot2)
# Plotting a Point chart displaying the mpg on highway for Audi, Honda and Nissan. Also showing 95% mean CI 
g1 <- ggplot(new_table, aes(new_table$year, new_table$hwy, color = new_table$manufacturer)) + 
  geom_point(aes(shape = new_table$manufacturer)) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=lower.range, ymax=higher.range, width = .5)) +
  xlab("Years") +
  ylab("Miles per gallon on Highways") +
  ggtitle("Point Chart with Mean 95% CI") +
  labs(colour='CAR MANUFACTURER') 
g1

# Plotting a Bar chart displaying the mpg on highway for Audi, Honda and Nissan. Also showing 95% mean CI 
g <- ggplot(new_table, aes(new_table$year, new_table$hwy, fill = new_table$manufacturer)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width = .8, position = "dodge") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=lower.range, ymax=higher.range, width = .5)) +
  xlab("Years") +
  ylab("Miles per gallon on Highways") +
  ggtitle("Bar Chart with Mean 95% CI") +
  labs(colour='CAR MANUFACTURER') 
g

```

The graphs shows that we have data for just 2 years - 1999 and 2008. 95% confidence interval for the whole data lies between 25.82 and 28.62
